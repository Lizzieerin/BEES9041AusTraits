Title,"AusTraits, A national database on the traits of Australia's complete flora",,,,
Description,"AusTraits is a transformative database, containing measurements on the traits of Australia's plant taxa, standardised from hundreds of disconnected primary sources. While this repository contains the harmonised data, the raw data and code used to build the resource are also available on the project's GitHub repository,http://traitecoevo.github.io/austraits.build. Further information on the project is available in the associated publication and at the project website https://austraits.org.",,,,

Source,"AusTraits data is derived from nearly 300 distinct sources, each contributed by an individual researcher, government entity (e.g. herbaria), or NGO. Each reflects the research agenda of the individual/organisation who contributed the data - the species selected, traits measured, manipulative treatments performed, and locations sampled encompass the diversity of research interests present in Australia throughout past decades. ",,,,
Access ,"Data was accessed from zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3568417), the downloaded it using the Austraits R package(https://github.com/traitecoevo/austraits). For our analysis we used a development version of the dataset available from the development branch of the austraits.bulid github repository (https://github.com/traitecoevo/austraits.build). ",,,,
